    <p><h2><em>What you'll need...</em></h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 12 oz French brie wheel</li>
        <li>4 sheets of thawed phyllo pastry*</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp melted butter</li>
        <li>1/3 C of St. Dalfour Preserves**</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp honey (optional)</li>
        <li>1-1 1/2 lb Bavette Steak</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp fresh chopped nuts (optional)</li>
        
    </ul>

    <p><h2><em>How to do it...</em></h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400ºF. Thaw the phyllo pastry overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Melt 4 Tbsp butter.</li>
        <li>Place one sheet of phyllo on a work surface and lightly coat with butter using a 
            <br>pastry brush. Place a second sheet over the first sheet along with more butter. 
            <br>Next a third with more butter. Finally add a fourth sheet of phyllo, but don't 
            <br>butter this one. Work quickly so that the phyllo doesn't dry out and become 
            <br>difficult to work with.</li>
        <li>Remove the brie from it's wrapping and place it into the middle of the phyllo. 
            <br>Measure 1/3 C of preserves and place it on top of the brie.</li>    
        <li>Wrap the brie by folding the phyllo onto it while coating the tops of the folds 
            <br>with butter. Be sure to check out my photo directions within the blog post.</li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated oven 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. </li>
        <li>Allow to sit for 3-5 minutes. Optionally garnish with a sprinkle of honey and 
            <br>chopped nuts. Serve hot with crackers or a sliced baguette and additional jam as desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><h2><em>Notes</em></h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>*This can be found in the freezer section of the grocery store</li>
        <li>** Apricot and a raspberry preserves are pictured. 
            <br>I prefer St Dalfour’s preserves because they are naturally sweetened and thick.</li>
    </ul>
