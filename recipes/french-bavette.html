    <p><h2><em>What you'll need...</em></h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shallots Thinly Sliced</li>
        <li>4 TBSP Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 Cup Beef Broth</li>
        <li>1 Cup Red Wine</li>
        <li>Salt and Freshly Ground Black Pepper</li>
        <li>1-1 1/2 lb Bavette Steak</li>
        <li>1 TBSP of Cold Butter in Chuncks</li>
        <li>A Grill or Pan</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h2><em>How to do it...</em></h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, saute the shallots in 2 tablespoons
            <br>of the olive oil until lightly caramelized, about 5 to 7 minutes. Raise the heat 
            <br>to high and add the red wine and reduce by half. Add the broth and reduce by half. 
            <br>Check for seasoning, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Keep warm on low heat.</li>
        <li>Brush the flank steak on both sides with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and season with 
            <br>the salt and pepper. Place on the center of grill and sear 5 to 8 minutes per side for 
            <br>rare to medium rare, testing by pressing the meat with a finger: The spongier the meat 
            <br>feels, the rarer it is cooked. Remove from the grill and allow to rest, very loosely 
            <br>tented with aluminum foil, 5 to 10 minutes, to allow the juices to reabsorb into the m
            <br>eat. Slice the flank steak on the diagonal and place on a large platter. Finish the 
            <br>sauce by swirling in the chunks of cold butter, then top the steak with some of the 
            s<br>auce and serve the rest on the side.</li>
    </ol>
