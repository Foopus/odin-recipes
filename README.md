# odin-recipes
A repo to store my practice projects for The Odin Project
In this project I'll practice and demonstrate the HTML skills I've picked up so far which include:
The use of images, links, headers, paragraphs, bold and italic text, ordered and unordered lists
Staging and confirming the project in Git and then pushing it to github
